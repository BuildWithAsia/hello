Let’s talk about that awkward, messy middle part of the journey. You know, the point where you’ve learned enough to know what you don’t know, but you’re still figuring out how to actually feel confident. This is the phase where a lot of people think about throwing in the towel. So if you’re there right now, trust me, you’re in good company.

Here’s the big question: How do you keep going when you feel stuck in that in-between? For me, it was about accepting that confidence isn’t a switch you flip on overnight. It’s more like something you build brick by brick every time you solve a problem or push through a tough spot.

Think about it this way: What if the frustration you feel now is just part of building a foundation for the confidence you’re going to have later? Every time you wrestle with a piece of code or struggle through a new concept, you’re actually teaching yourself resilience. And that resilience is what’s going to make you unstoppable down the road.

So if you’re feeling like you’re in the messy middle, remember: this is where real growth happens. This is where you’re building the kind of confidence that doesn’t just come from knowing all the answers but from knowing you can figure them out. Keep going, and trust that you’re not alone on this path.
