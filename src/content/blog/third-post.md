When you’re starting out in tech — or honestly, anything new — it’s easy to feel like you need to have all the answers right away. Spoiler alert: you don’t. In fact, trying to know it all from day one can trip you up more than it helps. What really matters is just putting one foot in front of the other, one step at a time.

In my own journey, I learned quickly that Google was my best friend. I didn’t have to memorize everything or figure it all out alone. I just had to be good at asking questions and not being afraid to say, “I don’t know this yet, but I can find out.”

The truth is, every time you look something up or ask for help, you’re training yourself to become a better problem solver. And that’s what being an engineer or a creator is all about. The more you get comfortable with that, the less daunting everything becomes. Eventually, you look back and realize that all those little steps added up to some pretty big strides.

So if you’re feeling overwhelmed or like you’re not moving fast enough, just remember: every question you ask, every tiny piece of progress you make, is a step forward. And that’s how you get where you’re going.
