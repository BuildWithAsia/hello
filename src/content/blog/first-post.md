For years, I built things quietly — websites, ideas, systems, frameworks, community projects, music, and, honestly, entire worlds inside my head. I’m finally giving all of that a home. This site is where my work, experiments, research, and  voice come together without getting swallowed by an algorithm.

I’m building a life and ecosystem that blends **tech, community, art, and clarity**. Not because it sounds impressive, but because that’s the only way any of this makes sense to me. I care about tools that make people’s lives easier, stories that make people think differently, and systems that help us breathe again. If my work can do even one of those things, then it’s worth sharing.

Here’s what you can expect from me moving forward:

- **Honest process.** I don’t pretend to have it all together. I’m figuring things out in real time.  
- **Tech + humanity.** AI, UX, civic tech, code — but with people, ethics, and liberation at the center.  
- **Creative work.** Music, commentary, design, visuals, writing, whatever I feel called to make.  
- **Projects that matter.** Solar Roots, Bridge Action Network, and anything else rooted in community and impact.  
- **Clarity over noise.** The internet is loud. I’m not contributing more chaos — I’m building structure.

This isn’t a typical “personal brand” space. It’s a working studio. A lab. A notebook. A launchpad. A place to document the work, not just talk about it.

If you’re here, thank you. If you’re returning, welcome back.  
Either way — I’m building, and this is the start.
