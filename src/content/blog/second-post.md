When I first stepped into tech, I didn’t know what software development meant. Not in a metaphorical way — I literally had no idea what those words were supposed to unlock. I only knew one thing: the world was changing fast, automation was taking over, and I needed skills that could help me survive whatever was coming next.

My only experience was a little HTML and CSS from years earlier. Nothing fancy. But I saw an ad for a coding program, and instead of talking myself out of it, I clicked. Before I knew it, I was in a five-day-a-week, eight-hour-a-day bootcamp feeling like everyone else was speaking a language I hadn't learned yet.

I showed up every day anyway.

The truth is, I didn’t walk out feeling like a developer. I didn’t feel confident. I didn’t feel “ready.” I felt overwhelmed, like I’d only scratched the surface of something massive. But that’s where the real learning started — *after* the program, when I was alone with my laptop, Googling everything, breaking things, fixing things, and slowly building the confidence I couldn’t find anywhere else.

It took me years of practicing on my own to feel like I could contribute to a team or finish a project I was proud of. Honestly, I’m still learning every day. But here’s what I want you to take from this: you don’t have to know everything at the beginning. You’re not supposed to. Every engineer you admire once sat exactly where you’re sitting — confused, frustrated, and wondering if they belonged.

What matters is that you keep going. That you ask questions. That you let yourself be new at something. Because every time you push through that frustration, you build a kind of confidence no one can take from you.

If you’re standing at the starting line right now, feeling unsure — trust me, you belong here. And you’re capable of more than you realize.
