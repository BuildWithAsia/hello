  <p>
    I’m <b>Asia Lakay Grady</b>—an engineer, creative technologist, and lifelong builder. This blog is my living notebook for the experiments, pivots, and wins that happen along the way. It’s not a highlight reel; it’s a timeline of curiosity in motion.
  </p>

  <p>
    I build where design, technology, and human need overlap. My work ranges from civic tech and cooperative systems to creative automation and digital storytelling. I like to build tools that make complex things feel simple—and make people feel seen.
  </p>

  <p>
    You’ll find reflections here on what I’m learning as I grow across disciplines: lessons from code, strategy, community, and the messy, beautiful middle ground where they meet. I write to document the process and remind myself that growth doesn’t have to look perfect to be real.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Currently building:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Deeds App — a platform for verified good deeds and social impact tracking</li>
      <li>Solar Roots Co-op — a community clean-energy initiative connecting local resilience to climate innovation</li>
      <li>B.R.I.D.G.E. Action Network — a digital grassroots network for empowerment, mutual aid, and creative collaboration</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    If you’re into honest process, creative problem-solving, or exploring how tech can serve people better—you’ll feel at home here.
